                            companies is that we train novice students and also make them work on Live projects. Web
                            design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually
                            refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software
                            development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers;
                            however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become
                            ever-increasingly important. At PN INFOSYS, we pride ourselves on being more than just
                            another IT company. One of the key aspects that makes us stand out is our commitment to
                            nurturing the next generation of IT professionals. We don't just provide theoretical
                            training to novice studentsâ€”we actively involve them in hands-on learning through live
                            projects. By doing this, we ensure that our trainees gain practical experience, develop
                            critical problem-solving skills, and are better prepared to tackle real-world challenges.
                            This unique approach gives our students a competitive edge, allowing them to transition
                            smoothly from learners to professionals.</p>

                        <p>Something which makes PN INFOSYS different from other IT companies is that we train novice
                            students and also make them work on Live projects. Web development is the work involved in
                            developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).
                            Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to
                            complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
                            comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web
                            engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side
                            scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.Among
                            Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of
                            building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management
                            systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>

                        <p>Something which makes PN INFOSYS different from other IT companies is that we train novice
                            students and also make them work on Live projects. Mobile app development is the act or
                            process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital
                            assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These software applications are
                            designed to run on mobile devices, such as a smartphone or tablet computer. These
                            applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as
                            web applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide
                            an "application-like" experience within a web browser. Application software developers also
                            must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware specifications, and configurations
                            because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms.
                            Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs created. A 2013
                            analyst report estimates there are 529,000 direct app economy jobs within the EU then 28
                            members (including the UK), 60 percent of which are mobile app developers.</p>
